Once upon a time, there was a man named Justin. 
Justin has been going through a break up and resulted to online dating except he was too broke to afford Tinder plus.
so he used craiglist ads to find his date. 
He found someone who he was interested in as the person was a PhD student at Clown University. 
Justin started directly messaging the PhD student who's name was Charlie. 
Charlie was from Topeka, Kansas. He enjoyed surfing, feeding his 23 chickens and bird watching.
